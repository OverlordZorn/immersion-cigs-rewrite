## Overview

This mod adds an ability to smoke cigarettes or enjoy lollipops.
While smoking, the cig will change it's model to a smaller version disappearing in the end (around 5 minutes) and producing smoke while it's active.
Mod is fully multiplayer compatible so you will hear the sound of the matches from other players and you'll see the smoke coming from the cigarette synchronized between all clients.

We do not encourage anyone to smoke in real life, we don't smoke irl, it's just a small addition in favour for some additional immersion.
